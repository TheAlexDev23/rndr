Runtime object deletion. 

- Attempt to use generics in component search
- Add ability for multiple cameras, but only render main
- Add object tags and search specific items with said tags. (e.g when searching for a rendering camera in mesh rendering search for the tag not for the component)
- Maybe think of a way to manage component dependencies
- Improve component search speed
